/*
	JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, programming language 
	with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting 
	language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as 
	node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, 
	dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, 
	and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
